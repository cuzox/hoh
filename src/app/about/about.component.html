            <h3>Title</h3>
            <p>There are few areas of the United States where we have truly impoverished communities of people.  Government programs are available to assist with housing, and to provide medical services and equipment for disabled.  There are food pantries and many non-profit organizations that assist with necessities.</p>
            <p>In the Dominican Republic, there are no government programs to assist the poor.  There are no food pantries or churches to help with building bathrooms, or seeing that children without birth certificates have an opportunity to still learn from a qualified teacher. </p>
