          The sponsored children in Capulin had a
          New Year’s Eve party. They were
          transferred from their community on a
          bus to a camp, where they attended Bible
          study, played on playground equipment,
          ate lots of food, made different crafts,
          and received gifts.

          The teens in this group also benefitted
          from a talk on appropriate behavior
          between the sexes.

          One of the treats in the DR at holiday
          time is to include fruit with their meals.
          When food bags were handed out at the
          New Year’s Eve party, each child took
          home sufficient food and fruit for their
          family
