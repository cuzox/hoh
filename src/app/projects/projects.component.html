          <h3 class='text-center'>Community Partnership</h3>
          <p>Hands of Hope has identified a number of communities, both urban and rural, for churches to partner with in developing long-range plans (generally about a 10 year project) to identify and prioritize community needs, such as schools, churches, medical clinics, community centers, water wells, and leadership mentoring. 
            Plans are developed based on priorities, funding opportunities, and the short-term member skills and experience.  Churches send short-term teams one or more times per year.  Hands of Hope staff work with the community and church leaders on an ongoing basis, providing consultation and assessment of progress, coordinating training for leaders and pastors, monitoring sponsored children and their families, etc.</p>
